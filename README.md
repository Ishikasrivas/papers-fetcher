# papers-fetcher

Fetch PubMed papers with at least one author affiliated with a pharmaceutical or biotech company, using a simple command-line tool.

---

## üöÄ Overview
This project provides a Python CLI tool to search PubMed for research papers matching a user query, and filter for papers with at least one author from a non-academic (pharma/biotech) company. Results can be saved as a CSV or printed to the console.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Flexible PubMed search**: Supports full PubMed query syntax.
- **Company author detection**: Uses heuristics to identify non-academic authors and company affiliations.
- **CSV output**: Save results to a file or print to the console.
- **Typed Python**: All code is type-annotated for clarity and safety.
- **Robust CLI**: Helpful options for debugging and output control.

## üóÇÔ∏è Code Organization
- `get_papers_list.py` : CLI entry point
- `papers_fetcher/`    : Core logic module
  - `fetch.py`         : Fetching, parsing, and filtering logic
  - `utils.py`         : Heuristics for affiliation detection
- `README.md`          : This file
- `.gitignore`         : Standard Python ignores
- `pyproject.toml`     : Poetry configuration

---

## üß† Heuristics for Non-Academic/Company Detection
- **Academic keywords**: Affiliations containing words like `university`, `institute`, `college`, `hospital`, etc. are considered academic.
- **Company keywords**: Affiliations with `pharma`, `biotech`, `inc`, `ltd`, `llc`, etc. are flagged as company.
- **Email domains**: Non-academic emails (not `.edu`, `.ac`, etc.) are considered company if found in the affiliation.
- **You can expand the keyword lists in `papers_fetcher/utils.py` for better accuracy.**
